# _Init : Vuejs 

This is my personal initializing project for vuejs project.

Uses the following libraries as default:

1. Since, VueJS uses webpack by default. I favoured it. Hard as it maybe but I finally learnt it. Just some default webpack implementation in the `vue.config.js` file.
2. `Pug.JS` as template engine.
3. `SCSS` as style pre-processor. I think I want to use `Stylus` in the future.



- Clone this project
- Change some stuffs in `package.json`. Like the project names or author name.
- `npm install`
- `npm run serve` for development.
- `.tern-project` was added for development in `vim` environment.
